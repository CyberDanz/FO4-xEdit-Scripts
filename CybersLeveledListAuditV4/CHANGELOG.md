# Changelog

## v4.1.0

### Added

- **Timestamped archive output.** Every run now also writes
  `LeveledListAudit_<timestamp>.txt` and `.csv`, which are never overwritten.
  Build a history without losing earlier runs.
- **Stable latest-run path retained.** `LeveledListAudit.txt` / `.csv` still
  always hold the most recent run, so you have one path to open.
- **Run comparison report.** `LeveledListAuditDiff.txt` compares this run
  against the previous latest CSV and lists findings under RESOLVED (present
  before, gone now) and NEW (not present before), with a net count. Findings
  are matched on tag, severity, list FormID, entry index and target FormID —
  not on the sequential ID, which shifts between runs.
- `SafeStamp`, `SplitCsv`, `FindingSig` helpers. The timestamp is built from
  `DateToStr`/`TimeToStr` rather than `FormatDateTime`, which is not confirmed
  present in the interpreter.

### Notes

- The diff reads the previous CSV before overwriting it, so the first run
  reports that there is nothing to compare against.
- A finding whose level or count changed but which is otherwise the same entry
  counts as unchanged, since those fields are not part of the signature.

## v4.0.2

Fixes a bug that made v4.0.1 output meaningless on a real load order.

### Fixed

- **Stale element handles.** `Process` stored `IInterface` handles in a
  `TStringList` and re-resolved them in `Finalize` via `ObjectToElement`. xEdit
  only guarantees handles remain valid inside the `Process` callback, so by the
  time `Finalize` ran, every `LinksTo` resolved to nothing. Symptoms: nearly
  every entry reported as `NULLREF`, every list reported as `ORPHAN`, and
  `Max nesting depth: 0` regardless of actual nesting.

  All analysis (`WalkList`, `SpreadCheck`, `InjectionCheck`) now runs inside
  `Process` while handles are live. `Finalize` only emits the orphan pass, from
  FormIDs and EditorIDs captured earlier, and writes the output files.

### Changed

- Report header moved from `Finalize` to `Initialize` so it precedes findings.
- `Process` relocated below its callees — the interpreter has no forward
  declarations.
- Added `slListNames` to carry list EditorIDs into the orphan pass.

## v4.0.1

Compatibility fixes for xEdit's Pascal interpreter (JvInterpreter), found on
first live run. No behaviour changes.

### Fixed

- `BoolToStr` is not available in the interpreter and aborted the script in
  `Finalize` while writing the report header. Replaced with an explicit
  `if`/`else`.
- `SameText` replaced with an `Uppercase` comparison in the injection pass.
- All `Pred(X)` loop bounds rewritten as `X - 1`.

## v4

### Added

- **Injection cross-check pass.** Walks the override chain of every leveled
  list and diffs entry sets at each step, attributing additions and removals to
  specific plugins. Three new tags:
  - `LOSTINJECT` (CRITICAL) — entries a plugin injected that are absent from the
    winning override. This is content silently missing from the game, and the
    single most common leveled list failure in a large load order.
  - `CLOBBER` (CRITICAL) — a plugin dropped entries present before it in the
    load order.
  - `INJECT` (INFO) — a plugin added entries. Provenance baseline.
- Tag key printed in the report header, explaining every tag in one place.
- Entry identity now keys on `FormID|Level|Count`, so two plugins adding the
  same item at different levels are tracked separately rather than collapsed.
- Name cache populated during the injection pass, so findings label entries by
  EditorID rather than bare FormID where possible.

### Fixed

- **Inconsistent record identity.** `Process()` indexed whatever record
  instance xEdit handed it, while `WinningPlugin()` reported a different one —
  output could contradict itself when auditing multiple plugins. `Process()`
  now anchors on `MasterOrSelf`, and `WalkList` / `SpreadCheck` resolve the
  winning override internally.
- **False `BALANCE` warnings.** The `tier > thi` check fired when `thi` was -1,
  meaning any list without a configured band produced spurious findings. Now
  guarded.
- **Potential exception in `slVisiting.Delete`.** Called with an unguarded
  `IndexOf` result, which would raise if the key was ever absent. Now checked.
- Empty-path handling in `WalkList` no longer produces a leading `>` separator
  on top-level lists.
- Null guards added to `KeyOf`, `IsLeveled`, `TierOfItem`, `DeriveTier`, and the
  tier lookup helpers.

### Changed

- LVLO target resolution factored into a shared `EntryTarget()` helper; the
  fallback logic was previously duplicated in three places.
- `EditorID` falls back to `Name` for records with no editor ID, in both report
  output and the name cache.
- Report header severity key expanded to note that CRITICAL now includes silent
  content loss, not only runtime breakage.

## v3

- Structured diagnostic logging with provenance, severity, and actionable fix
  text routed through a central `Log` procedure.
- Dual output: human-readable `.txt` and sortable `.csv`.
- Tag set: `CYCLE`, `NULLREF`, `COUNT`, `LEVEL`, `CHANCE`, `DEPTH`, `EMPTY`,
  `DUPE`, `SPREAD`, `BALANCE`, `ORPHAN`.
- Auto-derived item tiers on a 0–10 scale, with optional manual overrides via
  `lltiers.txt`.
- Cumulative Chance None tracking across nesting depth.
- Cycle detection and depth limiting.
